## How It's Made
**React**
> This site was built using <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">`React`</a>, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**The API**
> The data for this service is provided through the Covid-19 REST API. The link to this API can be found <a href='https://about-corona.net/documentation'>here</a>

**The Graphs**
> The graphs were made using the React wrapper for Chart.js <a href='https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2'>(Link)</a>

## Features
**Dashboard**
> This is the home page that the user lands on. At the top, today's number of deaths and cases is shown. Below, more general stats are shown:

- The total number of deaths in the UK from COVID-19
- The total number of infections in the UK from COVID-19
- The number of cases per million of the population in the UK
- The death rate of COVID-19 in the UK (ie the percentage of people who have died upon contracting the virus)
- The date of the first case of COVID-19 in the UK

> NOTE: A value of 0 means that the API is yet to provide this data at the time the website is viewed, but will update immediately upon the publishing of these stats.

---

**The Graphs**
> By clicking the 'Graphs' tab in the navbar, the user can see a page showing 2 graphs: one for deaths from COVID-19, and one for COVID-19 infections.

> These graphs help to visualise how the virus has developed over time in the UK.

> NOTE: Where there are missing bars, the data is unavailable for that day.
